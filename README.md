# Healthcare Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of healthcare data, focusing on patient demographics, visit patterns, and health metrics. The analysis leverages advanced SQL techniques such as joins, window functions, and common table expressions (CTEs) to uncover actionable insights. The project demonstrates data-driven decision-making skills essential for healthcare analytics.

## Key Insights
- **Patient Engagement**:
  - Recent checkups (primarily in 2024) show high healthcare engagement.
  - Patients with older checkup dates may require follow-ups.
- **Visit Patterns**:
  - Most patients had 1â€“5 visits, but a small subset (10+ visits) indicates chronic or recurring health needs.
- **Health Risks**:
  - 58% of patients are overweight or obese, requiring preventive healthcare interventions.
  - Elevated blood pressure readings were prevalent in older patients.
- **Resource Optimization**:
  - Diagnoses such as injuries have longer visit durations, necessitating better resource allocation.

## Future Applications
This analysis provides a framework for further exploration into healthcare data. It can be expanded to:
1. Identify patient clusters based on healthcare needs.
2. Develop predictive models for patient health risks.
3. Optimize hospital resource allocation based on visit patterns.
